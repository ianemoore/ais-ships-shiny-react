### Welcome to AIS_Demo

This app is built using AIS or 'Automatic Identification System' data, which is used by all ships at sea. The goal of this project was to take this set of data with ~3.2 million rows for ~1200 ships, and identify for what two points each ship would have traveled the greatest distance. 

Then using this cleaned data the goals of the application was to give the user the ability to select from a dropdown input the type of vessel, and from there use this to populate a second dropdown input with the names of all ships of that type. Then this should update a leaflet map that shows the two points associated with this greatest distance traveled, and in a small note pane render what the total distance traveled for that time period was.
